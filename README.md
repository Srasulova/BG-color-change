# BG-color-change

This is a basic project to practice JS skills by changing the background colors.

# Project Description

This project changes the background colors by clicking on the relative buttons.

I used minimal HTML, mainly focused on CSS and JavaScript.

Some of the challenges I faced while writing the code were working with constructors and trying out TypeScript.
